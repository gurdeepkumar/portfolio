            I'm Gurdeep Kumar, an aspiring software developer. Transitioning
            from coffee industry to tech, I’m passionate about building
            solutions that solves real-world problems.

            My journey in tech started back in school with C and C++, followed
            by a 3-year diploma in Computer Science. Life took me in a different
            direction, and I spent nearly a decade in the coffee
            industry—growing from barista to manager—where I developed strong
            problem-solving and people skills. Still, my passion for tech never
            faded. In 2020, I passed the CCNA exam out of love for networking.
            Then in Jan 2025, I decided to return to tech, completed a Python
            course from Harvard on edX, and began building backend-focused
            projects that combine my technical foundation with the real-world
            experience I bring from leading teams and thriving in fast-paced
            environments.
